    <h2> Description:</h2>
    <p> In this recipe, you will learn how to make your very own vanilla ice cream. It is clearly the most superior flavour of ice cream and any other flavour shall be demolished off the face of this world.<p>
    <p> Oh and also, if you eat hot ice cream, we have a problem.</p>  

    <h2> Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 quart heavy cream</li>
        <li> 1 ¼ cups milk</lI>
        <li> 1 vanilla bean, split and scraped</li>
        <li> 1 ¼ cups white sugar, divided</li>
        <li> 10 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> In a heavy saucepan over medium heat, combine cream and milk. Place vanilla bean and scrapings in pot, and sprinkle with half the white sugar. Allow to just come to a boil.</li>
        <li> Meanwhile, whisk the egg yolks together with the remaining sugar and the vanilla extract in a bowl. When the cream is ready, pour a third of it into the egg mixture, and whisk. Pour egg mixture into remaining hot cream and return to the heat until mixture coats the back of a metal spoon. Do not boil.</li>
        <li> Strain custard and chill until cold. Then pour into the canister of an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions.</li>
    </ol>
